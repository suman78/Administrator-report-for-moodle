MOODLE
Moodle is a free, open-source learning management system (LMS) used for creating and delivering online courses. It is a web-based platform that allows educators to create courses, add resources and activities, and interact with their students. Moodle is used by many educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and universities, as well as by businesses and organizations for employee training and development.

Moodle is highly customizable, and users can create their own themes, plugins, and modules to extend the functionality of the system. It includes features such as discussion forums, quizzes, assignments, wikis, and surveys, as well as tools for tracking student progress and grading assignments.

One of the key benefits of Moodle is that it is an open-source platform, meaning that the code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This has led to a large and active community of developers who have created a wide range of plugins and extensions to enhance Moodle's capabilities.
